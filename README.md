# Finance Company Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing financial data of companies to predict their net worth in the following year and to identify key factors that influence their financial health. The dataset contains various financial metrics, including net worth, total assets, income, expenses, profitability indicators, and other financial ratios.

## Files

-   `Finance_Company_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and modeling code.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Description

The dataset includes over 50 features related to the financial performance and health of companies. Key features include:

-   **Financial Metrics:** Net worth, total assets, total income, total expenses, profit after tax, PBDITA (Profit Before Depreciation, Interest, Taxes, and Amortization), PBT (Profit Before Tax).
-   **Ratios:** Debt-to-equity ratio, debtors turnover, finished goods turnover, WIP (Work in Progress) turnover, raw material turnover.
-   **Stock-Related Data:** Shares outstanding, equity face value, EPS (Earnings Per Share), adjusted EPS.
-   **Target Variable:** Networth Next Year (the value to be predicted).

## Libraries Used

-   `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
-   `numpy`: For numerical computations.
-   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
-   `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
-   `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization.
-   `sklearn`: For machine learning tasks, including data splitting and model evaluation.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Import and Cleaning:**
    -   Load the dataset using pandas.
    -   Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
    -   Correct inconsistencies and errors in the data.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Perform descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
    -   Create visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
    -   Identify key factors influencing the target variable (Networth Next Year).
3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
    -   Scale or normalize the data as needed.
4.  **Model Development:**
    -   Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    -   Select appropriate machine learning models for prediction (e.g., linear regression, random forest, etc.).
    -   Train the models on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    -   Evaluate the models on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
    -   Fine-tune the models to optimize performance.
6.  **Results and Conclusion:**
    -   Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the factors influencing financial health.
    -   Provide recommendations based on the analysis.
